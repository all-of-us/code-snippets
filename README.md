## How to add/update a workbench snippet

First see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for general getting started instructions.

If you want to add/modify a snippet that uses a dataframe from Dataset Builder as its input, then see [dataset-snippets/README](./dataset-snippets/README.md).

Otherwise, see the other snippets collections such as [sql-snippets/README](./sql-snippets/README.md) or [storage-snippets/README](./storage-snippets/README.md).
