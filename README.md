# Workbench snippets

## How to use the workbench snippets

Please see the welcome page for the [All of Us Researcher Workbench](https://workbench.researchallofus.org/). It has both a tutorial video and several articles in user support documentation.

## How to add/update a workbench snippet

First see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for general getting started instructions.

If you want to add/modify a snippet that uses a dataframe from Dataset Builder as its input, then see [dataset-snippets/README](./dataset-snippets/README.md).

Otherwise, see the other snippets collections such as

* [sql-snippets/README](./sql-snippets/README.md)
* [storage-snippets/README](./storage-snippets/README.md)
* [terra-widgets/README](./py/README.md)
